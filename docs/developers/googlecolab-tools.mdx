    I now can give a great answer.

    Final Answer: 

    Over the last decade, the field of exoplanet research has experienced significant advancements, leading to the discovery of thousands of exoplanets. These discoveries have been made possible through missions like NASA's Kepler and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), as well as ground-based observatories. Here is a summarized report on some of the notable exoplanet discoveries, including their size, potential habitability, and distance from Earth:

    1. **Kepler-452b**
       - **Size**: Approximately 1.6 times the radius of Earth
       - **Potential Habitability**: Located in the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could exist. It is often referred to as Earth's "cousin."
       - **Distance from Earth**: About 1,400 light-years

    2. **Proxima Centauri b**
       - **Size**: About 1.17 times the mass of Earth
       - **Potential Habitability**: Located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun. It has the potential to have liquid water.
       - **Distance from Earth**: 4.24 light-years

    3. **TRAPPIST-1 System**
       - **Size**: The system includes seven Earth-sized planets
       - **Potential Habitability**: Three of the planets (TRAPPIST-1e, TRAPPIST-1f, and TRAPPIST-1g) are located in the habitable zone and could potentially support liquid water.
       - **Distance from Earth**: Approximately 39 light-years

    4. **LHS 1140b**
       - **Size**: About 1.4 times the size of Earth and 6.6 times its mass
       - **Potential Habitability**: Located in the habitable zone of its star. It has a thick atmosphere and conditions that could support life.
       - **Distance from Earth**: About 40 light-years

    5. **Kepler-186f**
       - **Size**: Similar to Earth in size
       - **Potential Habitability**: The first Earth-sized planet discovered in the habitable zone of another star. It has potential for liquid water on its surface.
       - **Distance from Earth**: About 500 light-years

    6. **K2-18b**
       - **Size**: Approximately 2.6 times the radius of Earth
       - **Potential Habitability**: Located in the habitable zone of its star, with evidence of water vapor in its atmosphere.
       - **Distance from Earth**: About 124 light-years

    7. **GJ 357 d**
       - **Size**: About 6.1 times the mass of Earth
       - **Potential Habitability**: Located in the habitable zone of its star, with the potential to have liquid water on its surface.
       - **Distance from Earth**: About 31 light-years

    These discoveries highlight the diversity of exoplanets in terms of size, composition, and potential habitability. The search for exoplanets is crucial for understanding the potential for life beyond Earth and the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Ongoing and future missions, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, are expected to provide even more detailed information about these distant worlds.

    The continuous exploration and study of exoplanets will undoubtedly lead to new insights and perhaps even the discovery of life beyond our solar system.
