A workflow demonstrating how the Shopping Agent can search for products, compare prices, and provide shopping recommendations.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set API Key">
        Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create Script">
        Create a new file `shopping_assistant.py`:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, Tools
        from praisonaiagents.tools import duckduckgo

        # Create Shopping Agent
        shopping_agent = Agent(
            name="ShoppingAssistant",
            role="Shopping Specialist",
            goal="Find the best prices and deals across stores",
            instructions="You are a Shopping Agent",
            tools=[duckduckgo]
        )

        # Search for product prices
        response = shopping_agent.start(
            "I want to buy iPhone 16 Pro Max, check 5 stores and give me price in table"
        )
        
        # Save price comparison
        with open('price_comparison.md', 'w') as f:
            f.write(response)
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Shopping Assistant

The Shopping Agent combines multiple capabilities for effective price comparison:

1. **Store Search**: Uses DuckDuckGo to find retailers
2. **Price Analysis**: Gathers pricing information
3. **Price Comparison**: Compares prices across stores
4. **Deal Finding**: Identifies special offers and discounts
