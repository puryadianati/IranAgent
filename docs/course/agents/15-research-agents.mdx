# Building Research Agents

In this lesson, we'll build agents specialized in gathering, analyzing, and summarizing information. Research agents are valuable for quickly obtaining insights on various topics.

## What is a Research Agent?

A research agent is designed to:
- Find relevant information on specific topics
- Analyze and synthesize data
- Present findings in a clear, structured format
- Answer questions based on gathered information

## Creating a Basic Research Agent

Let's start by building a simple research agent:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create a basic research agent
research_agent = Agent(
    name="ResearchAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a research specialist who finds and summarizes information.
    
    When researching topics:
    1. Focus on finding accurate, current information
    2. Organize findings in a logical structure
    3. Identify key points and insights
    4. Cite sources when available
    5. Present information in a clear, concise format
    """
)

# Use the research agent
research_results = research_agent.start("Research the impact of renewable energy on reducing carbon emissions")
print(research_results)
```

## Adding Web Search Capability

To make our research agent more powerful, let's add web search capability:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Tool

# Define a web search function (simulated for this example)
def web_search(query):
    """
    Simulated web search function.
    In a real application, this would connect to a search API.
    
    Args:
        query (str): The search query
        
    Returns:
        str: Search results
    """
    # This is just a simulation - in a real application, you'd call a search API
    if "renewable energy" in query.lower():
        return """
        Search results for 'renewable energy carbon emissions':
        
        1. According to the IEA, renewable energy prevented 2.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2022.
        
        2. Solar and wind power generate electricity with 95-98% lower carbon emissions than coal-based electricity.
        
        3. The IPCC reports that renewable energy could deliver more than half of the emission reductions needed by 2030.
        """
    else:
        return f"Search results for '{query}' (simulated data)"

# Create the web search tool
search_tool = Tool(
    name="web_search",
    function=web_search,
    description="Search the web for current information on a topic"
)

# Create a research agent with web search capability
enhanced_research_agent = Agent(
    name="EnhancedResearchAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a research specialist who finds and summarizes information.
    
    When researching topics:
    1. Use the web_search tool to find current information
    2. Analyze and synthesize the search results
    3. Organize findings in a logical structure
    4. Identify key points and insights
    5. Present information in a clear, concise format
    """,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Use the enhanced research agent
enhanced_results = enhanced_research_agent.start("What is the impact of renewable energy on carbon emissions?")
print(enhanced_results)
```

## Research Agent with Structured Output

For more organized research results, we can instruct the agent to provide structured output:

```python
structured_research_agent = Agent(
    name="StructuredResearchAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a research specialist who finds and organizes information.
    
    When researching topics:
    1. Use available tools to find current information
    2. Analyze and synthesize the findings
    
    Always structure your response in this format:
    
    ## Summary
    [Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the topic]
    
    ## Key Facts
    - [Important fact 1]
    - [Important fact 2]
    - [Important fact 3]
    
    ## Analysis
    [Deeper analysis of the information, including implications]
    
    ## Sources
    [List of sources if available]
    """,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Use the structured research agent
structured_results = structured_research_agent.start("Research the latest advancements in quantum computing")
print(structured_results)
```

## Specialized Research Agents

Different research tasks require different approaches. Here are some specialized research agents:

### Comparison Research Agent

```python
comparison_agent = Agent(
    name="ComparisonAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a research specialist who compares different options or topics.
    
    When comparing items:
    1. Identify the key criteria for comparison
    2. Research each option thoroughly
    3. Create a clear side-by-side comparison
    4. Highlight advantages and disadvantages of each option
    5. Provide a balanced conclusion
    
    Present your findings in a structured table format when appropriate.
    """,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Use the comparison agent
comparison_results = comparison_agent.start("Compare solar and wind energy for residential use")
print(comparison_results)
```

### Literature Review Agent

```python
literature_agent = Agent(
    name="LiteratureAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a research specialist who reviews academic and professional literature.
    
    When reviewing literature:
    1. Identify key papers, articles, and studies on the topic
    2. Summarize the main findings and methodologies
    3. Identify trends, agreements, and contradictions
    4. Evaluate the strength of evidence
    5. Highlight gaps in current research
    
    Structure your review in a clear, academic format.
    """,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Use the literature review agent
literature_results = literature_agent.start("Review recent research on artificial intelligence in healthcare")
print(literature_results)
```
