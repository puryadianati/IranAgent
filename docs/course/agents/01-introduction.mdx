# Introduction to AI Agents

Welcome to the beginners' course on AI Agents! This course is designed to help you understand and build your own AI agents, even if you have little to no programming experience.

## What Are AI Agents?

An AI agent is a software program that can:
- Understand information from its environment
- Make decisions based on that information
- Take actions to achieve specific goals

Think of an AI agent like a helpful assistant that can perform tasks for you automatically.
