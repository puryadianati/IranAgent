# Content Creation Agents

Content creation agents can help generate various types of content, from blog posts to marketing materials. In this lesson, we'll learn how to build effective content creation agents.

## What is a Content Creation Agent?

A content creation agent is designed to:
- Generate written content based on specific requirements
- Structure content in appropriate formats
- Adapt tone and style to match the target audience
- Create content that achieves specific goals (inform, persuade, entertain)

## Creating a Basic Content Creation Agent

Let's start with a simple content creation agent:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create a basic content creation agent
content_agent = Agent(
    name="ContentCreator",
    instructions="""
    You are a versatile content creator who specializes in writing engaging material.
    
    When creating content:
    1. Understand the purpose and target audience
    2. Create a logical structure with clear sections
    3. Use an engaging, appropriate writing style
    4. Include a strong introduction and conclusion
    5. Format content for easy readability
    """
)

# Use the content creation agent
blog_post = content_agent.start(
    """
    Create a blog post about the benefits of meditation.
    Target audience: Busy professionals
    Length: Approximately 500 words
    Tone: Informative but conversational
    """
)
print(blog_post)
```

## Specialized Content Creation Agents

Different types of content require different approaches. Let's create specialized agents for various content needs:

### Blog Post Agent

```python
blog_agent = Agent(
    name="BlogWriter",
    instructions="""
    You are a blog post writer who creates engaging, informative articles.
    
    When writing blog posts:
    1. Create attention-grabbing headlines
    2. Start with a compelling introduction
    3. Use subheadings to organize content
    4. Include relevant examples and evidence
    5. Incorporate a clear call-to-action at the end
    
    Format your content with proper Markdown formatting including:
    - Headings (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
    - Bullet points for lists
    - *Italic* for emphasis
    - **Bold** for important points
    - > Blockquotes for notable quotes
    """
)

# Use the blog agent
blog_content = blog_agent.start(
    """
    Topic: 5 Ways to Improve Your Productivity
    Target audience: Remote workers
    Style: Practical, actionable advice
    Length: 800 words
    Include: Tips, examples, and research-backed information
    """
)
print(blog_content)
```

### Social Media Content Agent

```python
social_media_agent = Agent(
    name="SocialMediaCreator",
    instructions="""
    You are a social media content creator who crafts engaging posts.
    
    When creating social media content:
    1. Create attention-grabbing, concise content
    2. Adapt to the specific platform requirements
    3. Include relevant hashtags when appropriate
    4. Craft content that encourages engagement
    5. Consider visual elements that would pair well with the text
    
    For each platform, follow these guidelines:
    - Twitter/X: 280 characters max, punchy, relevant hashtags
    - LinkedIn: Professional tone, industry insights, 1-3 paragraphs
    - Instagram: Visual-focused descriptions, emoji-friendly, hashtags
    - Facebook: Conversational, can be longer, question-based engagement
    """
)

# Use the social media agent
social_content = social_media_agent.start(
    """
    Create posts for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook announcing:

    """
)
print(social_content)
```

### Email Campaign Agent

```python
email_agent = Agent(
    name="EmailWriter",
    instructions="""
    You are an email marketing specialist who creates effective email campaigns.
    
    When writing marketing emails:
    1. Create compelling subject lines that increase open rates
    2. Write engaging opening lines that hook the reader
    3. Keep content concise and focused on a single main message

    Structure your emails with:
    - Subject line

    """
)
print(email_content)
```

## Content Creation with Templates

Templates can help create more consistent content. Let's build an agent that works with templates:

```python
template_agent = Agent(
    name="TemplateWriter",
    instructions="""
    You are a content creator who works with templates to create consistent content.
    
    When filling a template:
    1. Maintain the overall structure of the template
    2. Replace placeholder text with appropriate content
    3. Ensure consistency in tone and style
    4. Adapt content to the specific requirements
    5. Review for coherence and flow
    
    Always preserve formatting elements like headings, lists, and emphasis.
    """
)

# Example template
product_review_template = """
# {Product Name} Review: {Brief Opinion}

## Quick Summary
**Rating:** {Rating}/10
**Price:** {Price Range}
**Recommended For:** {Target User}

## What We Liked
- {Positive Point 1}
