# Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems allow multiple AI agents to work together, each handling different parts of a complex task. This approach mirrors how human teams collaborate, with each member contributing their specialized skills.

## Why Use Multiple Agents?

  <Card title="Specialization" icon="star">
    Each agent can focus on its area of expertise
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Tasks" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Break down difficult problems into manageable pieces
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scalability" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Add more agents as tasks become more complex
  </Card>

## Basic Multi-Agent Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Research Agent] --> B[Analysis Agent]
    B --> C[Writing Agent]
    C --> D[Final Output]
```

In this example:
1. The Research Agent gathers information
2. The Analysis Agent processes and interprets the data
3. The Writing Agent creates the final content

## Multi-Agent Patterns

### 1. Pipeline Pattern

Agents work in sequence, with each agent handling a specific stage of the process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent 1] --> B[Agent 2]
    B --> C[Agent 3]
```

**Example Use Case**: Content creation where one agent researches, another drafts, and a third edits.

### 2. Expert Panel Pattern

Multiple specialist agents work in parallel on the same problem, then their outputs are combined.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Task --> A[Expert Agent 1]
    Task --> B[Expert Agent 2]
    Task --> C[Expert Agent 3]
    A --> D[Coordination Agent]
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> Result
```

**Example Use Case**: Financial analysis where different experts analyze market trends, economic indicators, and company performance.

### 3. Hierarchical Pattern

A manager agent delegates tasks to worker agents and coordinates their efforts.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Manager Agent] --> B[Worker Agent 1]
    A --> C[Worker Agent 2]
    A --> D[Worker Agent 3]
    B --> A
    C --> A
    D --> A
```

**Example Use Case**: Project management where a coordinator assigns tasks and integrates results.

## Implementing Multi-Agent Systems in PraisonAI

Here's a simple example of creating a multi-agent system:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, PraisonAIAgents

# Create individual agents
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Research the latest trends in renewable energy"
)

analysis_agent = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    instructions="Analyze the research findings and identify key insights"
)

writing_agent = Agent(
    name="Writer", 
    instructions="Create a clear, engaging report based on the analysis"
)

# Create a multi-agent system
agents = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[research_agent, analysis_agent, writing_agent]
)

# Start the agents
agents.start()
```

## Agent Communication

For agents to work together effectively, they need to communicate. This happens through:

## Designing Effective Multi-Agent Systems

<Tip>
Start simple with just 2-3 agents and a clear workflow before scaling to more complex systems.
</Tip>

Key principles for effective design:

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Each agent should have a specific and well-defined role
2. **Minimized Dependencies**: Reduce complex interdependencies between agents
3. **Standardized Communication**: Use consistent formats for information exchange
4. **Failure Handling**: Plan for cases where an agent fails to complete its task
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track how well each agent and the overall system performs

In the next lesson, we'll explore how to create effective agent workflows using the Process component.
