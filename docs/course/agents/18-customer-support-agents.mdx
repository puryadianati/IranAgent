# Customer Support Agents

Customer support agents can handle inquiries, resolve issues, and provide assistance to users. In this lesson, we'll learn how to build effective customer support agents.

## What is a Customer Support Agent?

A customer support agent is designed to:
- Answer frequently asked questions
- Troubleshoot common problems
- Provide information about products or services
- Collect information for support tickets
- Guide users through processes or procedures

## Creating a Basic Customer Support Agent

Let's start by building a simple customer support agent:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create a basic customer support agent
support_agent = Agent(
    name="SupportAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a helpful customer support representative for a software company.
    
    When helping customers:
    1. Greet them professionally and warmly
    2. Understand their issue completely before attempting to solve it
    3. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions when possible
    4. Maintain a friendly, patient tone throughout
    5. If you cannot solve the issue, explain how to escalate it
    
    Our software product is a productivity app with features for:
    - Task management
    - Calendar scheduling
    - Note-taking
    - Team collaboration
    """
)

# Use the support agent
response = support_agent.start("I'm having trouble syncing my calendar with my phone. Can you help?")
print(response)
```

## Adding a Knowledge Base

Let's enhance our agent with a simple knowledge base to answer common questions:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, KnowledgeBase

# Create a simple knowledge base
faq_kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Add FAQ content (in a real scenario, you would load this from files)
faq_kb.add_text("""

# Create an agent with the knowledge base
kb_support_agent = Agent(
    name="KnowledgeBaseAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a helpful customer support representative with access to our FAQ knowledge base.
    
    When helping customers:
    1. Greet them professionally and warmly
    2. Search the knowledge base for relevant information
    3. Provide clear, accurate answers based on the knowledge base
    4. If the knowledge base doesn't cover the question, provide general helpful guidance
    5. Maintain a friendly, supportive tone throughout
    """,
    knowledge_base=faq_kb
)

# Use the knowledge base support agent
kb_response = kb_support_agent.start("How do I cancel my subscription?")
print(kb_response)
```

## Creating a Troubleshooting Agent

Let's create an agent specialized in technical troubleshooting:

```python
troubleshooting_agent = Agent(
    name="TroubleshootingAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a technical support specialist who helps users troubleshoot problems.
    
    When troubleshooting:
    1. Ask clarifying questions to understand the exact issue
    2. Identify the most likely causes of the problem
    3. Provide step-by-step solutions, starting with the simplest fixes
    4. Explain what each step does and why it might help
    5. Confirm if the issue is resolved or suggest next steps
    
    Common troubleshooting areas:
    - Login and account access issues
    - App installation and updates
    - Feature functionality problems
    - Data synchronization
    - Performance issues
    """
)

# Use the troubleshooting agent
troubleshooting_response = troubleshooting_agent.start("The app keeps crashing when I try to open it on my iPhone")
print(troubleshooting_response)
```

## Building a Conversational Support Agent

Let's create a support agent that can handle multi-turn conversations:

```python
conversational_support = Agent(
    name="ConversationalSupport",
    instructions="""
    You are a customer support representative who handles support conversations.
    
    When handling support conversations:
    1. Maintain context throughout the conversation
    2. Ask follow-up questions when needed
    3. Verify understanding before providing solutions
    4. Be patient with users who may be frustrated
    5. Summarize the conversation and next steps at the end
    
    Our product is a mobile banking app with features for:
    - Account balance checking
    - Money transfers
    - Bill payments
    - Mobile check deposits
    - Budget tracking
    """
)

# Start a support conversation
initial_response = conversational_support.start("I can't find where to deposit checks in the app")
print("Initial Response:", initial_response)

# Continue the conversation
follow_up_response = conversational_support.continue("I'm using version 2.5 of the app on Android")
print("Follow-up Response:", follow_up_response)

# Further continuation
resolution_response = conversational_support.continue("I found the deposit button now, but it's giving me an error when I try to take a photo")
print("Resolution Response:", resolution_response)
```

## Support Ticket Creation Agent

Let's create an agent that can gather information for support tickets:

```python
ticket_agent = Agent(
    name="TicketCreationAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a support ticket creation specialist who gathers the necessary information to create support tickets.
    
    When creating a ticket:
    1. Collect the customer's name and contact information
    2. Identify the category of the issue
    3. Gather a detailed description of the problem
    4. Determine the severity level
    5. Collect relevant technical details (device, software version, etc.)
    6. Organize all information in a structured ticket format
    
    Present the final ticket in a clearly formatted structure.
    """
)

# Use the ticket creation agent
ticket = ticket_agent.start(
    """
    Create a support ticket for the following issue:
    
    Customer: Jane Smith
    Email: jane.smith@example.com
    Issue: Cannot access premium features after payment
    Details: Completed payment yesterday, received confirmation email, but premium features are still locked in the app
    Using: iPhone 13, app version 3.2.1
    """
)
print(ticket)
```
