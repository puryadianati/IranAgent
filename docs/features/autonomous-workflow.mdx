## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set API Key">
        Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a file">
        Create a new file `app.py` with the basic setup:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents
        import time

        def get_environment_state():
            """Simulates getting current environment state"""
            current_time = int(time.time())
            states = ["normal", "critical", "optimal"]
            state = states[current_time % 3]
            print(f"Environment state: {state}")
            return state

        def perform_action(state: str):
            """Simulates performing an action based on state"""
            actions = {
                "normal": "maintain",
                "critical": "fix",
                "optimal": "enhance"
            }
            action = actions.get(state, "observe")
            print(f"Performing action: {action} for state: {state}")
            return action

        def get_feedback():
            """Simulates environment feedback"""
            current_time = int(time.time())
            feedback = "positive" if current_time % 2 == 0 else "negative"
            print(f"Feedback received: {feedback}")
            return feedback

## Configuration Options

```python
# Create a monitor agent
monitor = Agent(
    name="Environment Monitor",
    role="State analyzer",
    goal="Monitor and analyze state",
    tools=[get_environment_state],  # Environment monitoring tools
    verbose=True  # Enable detailed logging
)

# Create an action agent
action = Agent(
    name="Action Executor",
    role="Action performer",
    goal="Execute appropriate actions",
    tools=[perform_action]  # Action execution tools
)

# Create monitoring task
monitor_task = Task(
    name="monitor_environment",
    description="Monitor environment state",
    agent=monitor,
    is_start=True,
    task_type="decision",
    condition={
        "normal": ["execute_action"],
        "critical": ["execute_action"],
        "optimal": "exit"
    }
)

# Create feedback loop task
feedback_task = Task(
    name="process_feedback",
    description="Process and adapt",
    agent=feedback_agent,
    next_tasks=["monitor_environment"],  # Create feedback loop
    context=[monitor_task, action_task]  # Access history
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitoring Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If monitoring fails:
    - Check environment access
    - Verify state detection
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
  </Card>

  <Card title="Adaptation Flow" icon="diagram-project">
    If adaptation is incorrect:
    - Review feedback processing
    - Check action outcomes
    - Verify learning loop
  </Card>
