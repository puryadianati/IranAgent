  <Tab title="Code">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Install Package">
            First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
            ```bash
            pip install praisonaiagents
            ```
        </Step>

        <Step title="Set API Key">
            Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
            ```bash
            export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
            ```
        </Step>

            Create a new file `app.py` with the basic setup:
            ```python
            from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Tools

            # Create reasoning agent

### Configuration Options

```python
# Create an agent with reasoning configuration
agent = Agent(
    role="Problem Solver",
    goal="Solve complex problems",
    backstory="Expert in problem-solving",
    tools=[Tools.internet_search],
    verbose=True,  # Enable detailed logging
    llm="gpt-4o"  # Language model to use
)

# Task with reasoning requirements
task = Task(
    description="Solve complex problem",
    expected_output="Detailed solution",
    agent=agent
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Reasoning Errors" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If reasoning seems incorrect:
    - Check problem description clarity
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
    - Review agent configuration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Process Flow" icon="code">
    If process flow is unclear:
    - Verify task dependencies
    - Check agent roles and goals
    - Review task descriptions
