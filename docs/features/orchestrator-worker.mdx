A workflow with a central orchestrator directing multiple worker LLMs to perform subtasks, synthesizing their outputs for complex, coordinated operations.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set API Key">
        Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a file">
        Create a new file `app.py` with the basic setup:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents
        import time

        def get_time_check():
            current_time = int(time.time())
            if current_time % 3 == 0:
                result = 1
            elif current_time % 3 == 1:
                result = 2
            else:
                result = 3
            print(f"Time: {current_time}, Result: {result}")
            return result

        # Create orchestrator and worker agents

            agent=synthesizer,
            context=[worker1_task, worker2_task, worker3_task]
        )

        # Create workflow manager
        workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
            agents=[router, worker1, worker2, worker3, synthesizer],
            tasks=[router_task, worker1_task, worker2_task, worker3_task, synthesize_task],
            process="workflow",
            verbose=True
        )

        # Run orchestrated workflow
        results = workflow.start()

        # Print results
        print("\nOrchestrator-Workers Results:")
        for task_id, result in results["task_results"].items():
            if result:
                print(f"Task {task_id}: {result.raw}")
        ```

        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

## Understanding Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

<Card title="What is Orchestrator-Worker?" icon="question">
  Orchestrator-Worker pattern enables:
  - Dynamic task distribution and routing
  - Specialized worker execution
  - Result synthesis and aggregation
  - Coordinated workflow management
</Card>

## Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Task Routing" icon="route">
    Intelligently distribute tasks to specialized workers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Worker Specialization" icon="user-gear">
    Dedicated agents for specific task types.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Result Synthesis" icon="object-group">
    Combine and process worker outputs effectively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Process Control" icon="sliders">
    Monitor and manage the orchestrated workflow.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration Options

```python
# Create an orchestrator agent
router = Agent(
    name="Router",
    role="Task router",
    goal="Distribute tasks based on conditions",
    tools=[get_time_check],  # Tools for routing decisions
    verbose=True  # Enable detailed logging
)

# Create a worker agent
worker = Agent(
    name="Worker",
    role="Specialized worker",
    goal="Handle specific task type",
    instructions="Processing instructions"
)

# Create routing task
router_task = Task(
    name="route_task",
    description="Route tasks to workers",
    agent=router,
    is_start=True,
    task_type="decision",
    condition={
        "1": ["worker1_task"],
        "2": ["worker2_task"]
    }
)

# Create synthesis task
synthesis_task = Task(
    name="synthesize",
    description="Combine worker results",
    agent=synthesizer,
    context=[worker1_task, worker2_task]  # Reference worker tasks
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routing Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If task routing fails:
    - Check routing conditions
    - Verify worker availability
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
  </Card>

  <Card title="Synthesis Flow" icon="diagram-project">
    If result synthesis is incorrect:
    - Review worker outputs
    - Check context connections
    - Verify synthesis logic
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  For optimal results, ensure your routing logic is well-defined and your workers are properly configured for their specialized tasks.
